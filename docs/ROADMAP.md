# Globify Tech — Roadmap

Phases follow the build order in the master brief. Status reflects what is in this repository and what has actually been verified running, not what was planned.

## Verification at the time of writing

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Passes |
| `pnpm lint` | 0 errors, 3 warnings from React Hook Form and TanStack Table |
| `pnpm test` | 122 tests pass across 7 files |
| `pnpm test:db` | 18 integration tests pass against a real PostgreSQL |
| `pnpm build` | Passes; 180 routes, 35 prerendered |
| Migrations | Both apply from an empty database |
| Seed | Runs end to end and is idempotent |
| Runtime | 38/38 admin, 16/16 instructor, 19/19 student pages and the employer portal render signed in, against seeded data |

| 16 | Deployment: migrations, Docker, compose, backups, health, CI, docs | Done |

## Known gaps

These are real limitations, not oversights. They are listed so nobody discovers them in production.

**Payment providers are implemented but not certified.** Stripe and PayPal follow the documented APIs; JazzCash and Easypaisa follow their integration guides but have not been run against a live merchant account. Bank transfer and cash work fully today because they are recorded by staff. Certify the gateways before taking online payment at volume.

**Live class providers other than Zoom degrade to manual.** Zoom uses server-to-server OAuth and its webhooks are handled. Google Meet and Teams accept a meeting link that an instructor pastes in; there is no automatic room creation.

**Translations are stubs.** The i18n architecture is complete, including right-to-left support, and every string goes through it. The Urdu, Arabic and Punjabi bundles currently fall back to English and need a translator.

**AI features need a provider key.** Without one, the tutor, course builder and admin assistant show a clear "not configured" state rather than failing. That is deliberate, but it means those features are unproven against a live model in this repository.

**Exams have no proctoring.** Attempts are timed, shuffled and logged, but nothing prevents a student opening another window.

**The embedded PostgreSQL is for development only.** It keeps a single session, so Prisma needs `pgbouncer=true`, and a long-running session can accumulate prepared statements until it is restarted. Use a real PostgreSQL anywhere that matters.

**No end-to-end browser tests.** Pages were verified by signing in and requesting every route, and the engines are unit tested, but there is no Playwright suite driving the interface.

## Next

- Native mobile apps consuming `/api/v1`, which already covers courses, the student dashboard, progress, notifications, payments, leads, applications and certificate verification.
- An OpenSearch driver for `SearchProvider`, which is already an interface.
- Production certification for JazzCash and Easypaisa.
- Live proctoring for exams.
- Urdu, Arabic and Punjabi translations.
- SCORM and xAPI import.
- Playwright coverage for the enrolment, payment and grading journeys.
